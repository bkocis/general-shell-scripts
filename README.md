- `batt-stat` is a `sensors` based script that pretty-prints current power state

- `suspend-if-battery-low.sh` - crontab based script that checks the battery status and in case of power is less then a chosen threshold value, an alarm tune is played, or the system is put to suspend, saving from an unwanted shutdown due to lack of power 

- `ascii collection` contains asciis for any purpose
